<h1>About This Project</h1>
	
	<h2>This App Needs JavaScript</h2>
<div class="img-para">

<p>This web application makes use of JavaScript for both toggling the individual data items as HTML elements and grabbing a random choice from the enabled elements. To be clear, <mark>you must have JavaScript enabled in your browser</mark> for this to work properly. If not, the app may not be able to produce the intended results.</p>
<noscript><br>If you are seeing this message, you don't have JavaScript enabled! Visit <a href="https://www.enable-javascript.com/">this website</a> to learn how to turn it on.</noscript>

		<h2>Powered by Vue.js</h2>

<p>The code behind this project is fueled by Vue.js, a unique and highly adaptive development kit for web-based applications. Vue allows for dynamic development, and it's also the reason that the <tt>Inspect Element</tt> code looks very different from the source code on GitHub. This is my first larger-scale project to make use of Vue, so some of my implementations may not be perfect, but I'm always learning and adjusting my code as I improve!<br><br>To learn more about Vue.js, check out <a href="https://vuejs.org/">their site</a>.</p>

<p>This project is hosted courtesy of GitHub. The code backing this webapp is also open-source in a GitHub repository, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/adamhaertter/random-character">here</a>. If you notice a problem that wasn't solved above or find an error I didn't catch, feel free to leave either an issue or pull request in the repo linked above. While I have a lot of things I want to try to accomplish with this project, I am also open to suggestions!</p>
